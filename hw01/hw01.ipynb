    "**Question 4.2.** The study found that of the children who slept with a room light on before the age of 2, 55% were myopic. Of the children who slept with a night light on before the age of 2, 34% were myopic. Of the children who slept in the dark before the age of 2, 10% were myopic. The study concluded that, \"The prevalence of myopia [...] during childhood was strongly associated with ambient light exposure during sleep at night in the first two years after birth.\"\n",
