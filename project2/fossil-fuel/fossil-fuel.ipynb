    "In this assignment, you will be investigating monthly fossil fuel consumption in the United States from January 2001 to July 2020. This type of data is called a time series. Time series data consists of a series of observations recorded in time, where the order of the observations is crucial because they're dependent on the previous observations. \n",
    "\n",
    "In our case, we want to investigate monthly fossil fuel consumption because we want to know if the COVID-19 lockdown affected people's decisions to consume/use fossil fuels and how much effect it had over the months. For example, since the lockdown, people may feel scared to drive outside and thus, use less fuel.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our dataset, fossil fuel consumption includes coal, natural gas, and petroleum/petroleum products. The units are in quadrillion Btu, or British thermal unit. A British thermal unit is the amount of heat required to raise one pound of water by 1 degree Fahrenheit. \n",
