    "## 2. Defining functions\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's write a very simple function that converts a proportion to a percentage by multiplying it by 100.  For example, the value of `to_percentage(.5)` should be the number 50.  (No percent sign.)\n",
    "\n",
    "A **function definition** has a few parts:\n",
    "* a keyword `def`\n",
    "* a name of the function\n",
    "* a function \"signature\"\n",
    "* highly recommended documentation of the function\n",
    "* a body of the function\n",
    "* a `return` statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look closely at each part.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### `def`\n",
    "It always starts with `def` (short for **def**ine):\n",
    "\n",
    "    def\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Name\n",
    "Next comes the name of the function. When you are creating functions, you get to name them. Remember that meaningful function names make your code easier to read and understand.  Let's call our function `to_percentage`.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    def to_percentage\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Signature / declaration\n",
    "Next comes something called the *signature* of the function.  It tells Python how many arguments your function should have, and what names you'll use to refer to those arguments in the function's code.  \n",
    "\n",
    "> *Definition alert*: \n",
    "> * **Parameter** is a variable defined in the function signature/declaration.\n",
    "> * **Argument** is the *actual value* of this variable that get passed to the function during the *function call*. \n",
    "\n",
    "`to_percentage` should take one argument, and we'll call that argument `proportion` since it should represent a proportion that we want to convert.\n",
    "\n",
    "    def to_percentage(proportion)\n",
    "    \n",
    "*Note:* it is up to us what to call the parameters; just like with the other variables that we create, we get to name the parameters in the function signature.\n",
    "    \n",
    "If we had more parameters, we would separate them with commas. Note that the parameters are always included within the opening `(` and closing `)` set of parentheses.\n",
    "\n",
    "We put a colon after the signature to tell Python that we are finished with the signature.\n",
    "\n",
    "    def to_percentage(proportion):\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Documentation\n",
    "Functions can do complicated things, so you should write an explanation of what your function does.  For small functions, this is less important, but it's a good habit to learn from the start.  Conventionally, Python functions are documented by writing a triple-quoted string:\n",
    "\n",
    "    def to_percentage(proportion):\n",
    "        \"\"\"Converts a proportion to a percentage.\"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "The triple-quoted string allows you to write a multi-line comment. For example, we could have also written it as follows (helpful when you have more a complicated signature):\n",
    "\n",
    "    def to_percentage(proportion):\n",
    "        \"\"\"\n",
    "        Converts a proportion to a percentage.\n",

    "        Return: percentage\n",
    "        \"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "    \n",
    "#### Body\n",
    "Now we start writing code that runs when the function is called.  This is called the *body* of the function and every line **must be indented with a tab**.  Any lines that are *not* indented and left-aligned with the `def` statement are considered to be *outside the function*. \n",
    "\n",
    "Some notes about the body of the function:\n",
    "- We can write code that we would write anywhere else.  \n",
    "- We use the _parameters_ defined in the function signature. We can do this because we assume that when we call the function, values (which we call *arguments*) are already assigned to those parameters.\n",
    "- We generally avoid referencing variables defined *outside* the function. If you would like to reference variables outside of the function, pass them through as arguments!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's give a name to the number we multiply a proportion by to get a percentage:\n",
    "\n",
    "    def to_percentage(proportion):\n",
    "        \"\"\"Converts a proportion to a percentage.\"\"\"\n",
    "        factor = 100\n",
    "\n",
    "#### `return`\n",
    "The special instruction `return` is part of the function's body and tells Python to make the value of the function call equal to whatever comes right after `return`.  We want the value of `to_percentage(.5)` to be the proportion .5 multiplied by the factor 100, so we write:\n",
    "\n",
    "    def to_percentage(proportion):\n",
    "        \"\"\"Converts a proportion to a percentage.\"\"\"\n",
    "        factor = 100\n",
    "        return proportion * factor\n",
    "        \n",
    "`return` only makes sense in the context of a function, and **can never be used outside of a function**. `return` is always the last line of the function because Python stops executing the body of a function once it hits a `return` statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Side note:* we can have a complicated function that can have multiple `return` values, but in this class, we will constrain ourselves to the single `return` at the end of the function body.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important:**  `return` inside a function tells Python what value the function evaluates to. However, there are other functions, like `print`, that have no `return` value. For example, `print` simply prints the provided arguments to the console. \n",
    "\n",
    "`return` and `print` are **very** different. Do not use them interchangeably!\n",
    "\n",
    "*Note:* If a function does not have an explicit `return` statement, then Python automatically returns `None` to indicate that there was no value to return.\n",
    "\n",
    "-----\n",
    "\n",
    "That's it! We just finished defining a new function called `to_percentage`. This name now refers to the sets of steps that we included in the function body and just like other named things, functions stick around after you define them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, in order to use/execute `to_percentage`, we need to **_call_ this function** and provide some specific _values_ as its **input arguments**, which will be substituted for the **parameters** that we defined in the function signature.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, to convert 0.99 using our function, we would call it as follows: \n",
    "`to_percentage(.99)`. If we want to save the result of this function call, we would need to assign its return value to a variable, which you'll get to do in the example below."
